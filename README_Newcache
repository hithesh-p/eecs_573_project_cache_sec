This is gem5 extension to support modeling of Newcache

1. to build the simulator, type
   
   scons build/ARCH/gem5.opt

   where ARCH can be one of X86, ARM, ALPHA and so on. For more information, check out: http://www.gem5.org/Introduction

2. running gem5 with Newcache (for both SE and FS mode) is of no difference than running gem5 with other caches except some extra command line options, which are summarized below:

--l1d_alg/l1i_alg/l2_alg/l3_alg

replacement algorithm, possible value: "NEWCACHE", "LRU" (default)

--l1d_nebit/l1i_nebit/l2_nebit/l3_nebit

number of extra index bits, default is 4

note that --l1d_assoc/l1i_assoc/l2_assoc/l3_assoc needs to be changed accordingly for Newcache, which represents the total number of cache lines



3. There are some more command line options specific to system call emulation (SE) mode to set protection bit for a process, by default, no memory region is protected.

--need_protect 

indicate the process is security sensitive

--protected_start

start file offset of the protected region

--protected_end

end file offset of the protected region



4. In full system (FS) mode, both processor-side interface and OS-side interface are required to set the protection bit (by default, protection bit is not set). The processor-side interface needs to provide either a new instruction or a new page table field to indicate the protection bit. We implemented page-based protection for x86. We use bit 11 (available for programmer) in the page table entry as protection bit. OS-side interface is the new system call (or extending the existing system call) to set the protection bit.

Similarly, RMT_ID is 0 by default and both processor-side interface and OS-side interface are required to set the RMT_ID. For x86, we use the reserved control register 1 (CR1) as the processor-side interface to store the RMT_ID. OS is responsible to set RMT_ID and resolve any potential read-write synonym.



5. We provide two example scripts for SE and FS mode, respectively, as regression test, under regression directory
5.1 aes.sh (SE mode)
this script shows how to run a security sensitive program with Newcache. The python configuration script used is configs/example/se_newcache.py

5.2 hello.sh and hello_checkpoint.sh (FS mode)
these scripts show how to run a program in FS mode with Newcache. The .rcS script can be found under configs/boot/hello.rcS, and the binary is contained in the linux-x86.img. We first take a checkpoint after booting the OS (by running hello_checkpoint.sh), and the checkpoint is under the directory regression/hello. Then we run hello.sh to skip the booting of OS with Newcache. 

6. the disk image and linux kernel can be downloaded in gem5's website http://www.gem5.org
